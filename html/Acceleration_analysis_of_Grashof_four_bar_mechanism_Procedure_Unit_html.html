<li>Edit the parameters in variable section and observe the changes taking place in the acceleration diagram of the four bar mechanism</li>
<li>Table will show the value of the parameters</li>
<li>Notice that there are two accelerations of a point on a rotating link. One acceleration (Centripetal, magnitude =r&omega;<sup>2</sup>) is along the link directed towards the point about which the link is rotating. The other acceleration (tangential, magnitude =r&alpha;) is perpendicular to the link and directed in the direction of rotation of link.</li>
<li>Total acceleration of the point on the link is the resultant of centripetal and tangential accelerations.</li>
